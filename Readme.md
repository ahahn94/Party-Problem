# Party-Problem
#### Example Implementations of the Party Problem

## The Party Problem
For a given list of party guests and a given number of friends that each guest should have under the other guests, 
this algorithm removes the guests from the list that have fewer than k friends.  

## Languages
The algorithm has been implemented in the following languages:  
- C
- CoffeeScript (CLI via Node.js)
- C++
- C#
- Dart
- Go
- Java
- JavaScript (CLI via Node.js)
- Kotlin
- Kotlin-Native
- PHP
- Python
- Qt 5 (and C++)
- Ruby
- Rust
- Swift
- TypeScript (CLI via Node.js)
- VB.NET

### These implementations use a recursive approach to solve the problem.
