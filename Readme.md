# Party-Problem
#### Example Implementations of the Party Problem

## The Party Problem
For a given list of party guests and a given number of friends that each guest should have under the other guests, 
this algorithm removes the guests from the list that have fewer than k friends.  

## Languages
The algorithm has been implemented in the following languages:  
- C++
- Go
- Java
- Kotlin
- Python
- Ruby
- Rust

### These implementations use a recursive approach to solve the problem.
